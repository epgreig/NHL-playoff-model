## Formatting the input files

1. download corsica files for appropriate year, one for 5v5 and one for all states
2. create a misc_stats_playoff_wins_YEAR.csv
3. in this file, organize teams in alphabetical order of team name, but with corsica shorthand. **notice that order is different from corsica, where alphabetization is taken from shorthand itself.
4. when pasting time_led (from morehockeystats), format as number (number of days) and multiply by 24 to get a decimal in minutes.
5. for NHL.com, save dataset as preview, copy paste from there. PP% and PK% must be split into columns first ('space' as delimiter), and then pasted with transpose tag
