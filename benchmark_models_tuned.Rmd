## Hyperparameter Tuning on RF model
```{r}
# Grids attempted:
#rf_grid(df, mtrys=1:4, nodesizes=40:100)
rf_grid(df, mtrys=1, nodesizes=45:70, ntrees=5000)

# result: mtry=1, nodesize=64
```

## Calculate Tuned Random Forest (Regression) Performance
```{r}
cv_rf_reg(df, nfolds=10, nruns=32, mtry=1, nodesize=64)
# BENCHMARK
# Log Loss: 0.687 (sd 0.10)
# Accuracy: 59%

# AFTER TUNING
# Log Loss: 0.660 (sd 0.05)
# Accuracy: 61%
```

## Calculate Tuned Random Forest (Classification) Performance
```{r}
cv_rf_class(df, nfolds=10, nruns=24, mtry=1, nodesize=64)
# BENCHMARK
# Log Loss: 0.683 (sd 0.08)
# Accuracy: 60%

# AFTER TUNING
# Log Loss: 0.668 (sd 0.10)
# Accuracy: 63%
