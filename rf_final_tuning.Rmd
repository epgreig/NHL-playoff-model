## Define subsets of full features
```{r}
df_10 <- df[,c('Home_Won', dStats_10)]
df_5 <- df[,c('Home_Won', dStats_5)]
df_4 <- df[,c('Home_Won', dStats_4)]
```

## Hyperparameter Tuning on reduced feature set RF (10 features)
```{r}
# Grid Search using randomForest's built in OOB error (not cross-validated Log Loss).
# Prioritize lower mtry (less correlation btw trees) and higher nodesize (smoothing out regression)

# Grids attempted:
#rf_grid(df_10, mtrys=1:2, nodesizes=30:100, ntrees=5000)
rf_grid(df_10, mtrys=1, nodesizes=48:65, ntrees=30000)

# result: mtry=1, nodesize=55
```

## Hyperparameter Tuning on reduced feature set RF (4 best features)
```{r}
# Grid Search using randomForest's built in OOB error (not cross-validated Log Loss)
# Prioritize lower mtry (less correlation btw trees) and higher nodesize (smoothing out regression)

# Grids attempted:
#rf_grid(df_best, mtrys=1:2, nodesizes=20:100, ntrees=5000)
rf_grid(df_best, mtrys=1, nodesizes=40:80, ntrees=10000)

# result: mtry=1, nodesize=73
```

## Hyperparameter Tuning on test feature set RF (5 test features)
```{r}
# Grid Search using randomForest's built in OOB error (not cross-validated Log Loss)
# Prioritize lower mtry (less correlation btw trees) and higher nodesize (smoothing votes)

# Grids attempted:
#rf_grid(df_test, mtrys=1:2, nodesizes=20:100, ntrees=10000)
rf_grid(df_test, mtrys=1, nodesizes=40:75, ntrees=30000)

# result: mtry=1, nodesize=45, 71
```
